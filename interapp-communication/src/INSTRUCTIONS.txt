Instructions for running the HTML Interapp Communication Demo

1. Launch the OpenFin App Desktop
2. Launch Excel and add the Excel add-in ofs-add-in-32.xll or ofs-add-in-64.xll depending on your version of Excel. For help on how to do this, please see http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/add-or-remove-add-ins-HP010342658.aspx 
3. Open the Excel spreadsheet InterAppCommDemo.xls. 
4. Double click on run.bat. A C# Application window will appear. 
5. Press "Connect". An HTML application called "HTML Interapp Communication Demo" will appear.
6. In the C# Application, Enter a topic and some data and press "Send". The Topic 
and Data will appear in the HTML Application. The HTML application
will perform some transformation on the data. In this case we have chosen to 
make the data uppercase. The data will also be sent to the Excel spreadsheet, 
which will populate the cell called "Incoming Data".
7. Bring up the HTML Application and click "Send to spreadsheet". The transformed 
data will also be sent to the Excel spreadsheet under the "Transformed Data" cell.
